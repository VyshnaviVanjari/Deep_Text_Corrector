"“ Yes , indeed , ” said Nearly Headless Nick knowledgeably , leaning across Neville toward her ( Neville winced , it was very uncomfortable to have a But Professor McGonagall , who was waiting to read out the list of first years ' names , was giving the whispering students the sort of look that scorches . Nearly Headless Nick placed a see - through finger to his lips and sat primly upright again as the muttering came to an abrupt end . With a last frowning look that swept the four House tables , Professor McGonagall lowered her eyes to her long piece of parchment and called out , “ Abercrombie , Euan . ” The terrified - looking boy Harry had noticed earlier stumbled forward and put the hat on his head ; it was only prevented from falling right down to his shoulders by his very prominent ears . The hat considered for a moment , then the rip near the brim opened again and shouted , “ GRYFFINDOR ! ” Harry clapped loudly with the rest of Gryffindor House as Euan Abercrombie staggered to their table and sat down , looking as though he would like very much to sink through the floor and never be looked at again . Slowly the long line of first years thinned ; in the pauses between the names and the Sorting Hat 's decisions , Harry could hear Ron 's stomach rumbling loudly . Finally , “ Zeller , Rose ” was sorted into Hufflepuff , and Professor McGonagall picked up the hat and stool and marched them away as Professor Dumbledore rose to his feet . Harry was somehow soothed to see Dumbledore standing before them all , whatever his recent bitter feelings toward his headmaster . Between the absence of Hagrid and the presence of those dragonish horses , he had felt that his return to Hogwarts , so long anticipated , was full of unexpected surprises like jarring notes in a familiar song . But this , at least , was how it was supposed to be : their headmaster rising to greet them all before the start - of - term feast . There was an appreciative laugh and an outbreak of applause as Dumbledore sat down neatly and threw his long beard over his shoulder so as to keep it out of the way of his plate — for food had appeared out of nowhere , so that the five long tables were groaning under joints and pies and dishes of vegetables , bread , sauces , and flagons of pumpkin juice . “ Excellent , ” said Ron , with a kind of groan of longing , and he seized the nearest plate of chops and began piling them onto his plate , watched wistfully by Nearly Headless Nick . “ What were you saying before the Sorting ? ” Hermione asked the ghost . “ About the hat giving warnings ? ” “ Oh yes , ” said Nick , who seemed glad of a reason to turn away from Ron , who was now eating roast potatoes with almost indecent enthusiasm . “ Yes , I have heard the hat give several warnings before , always at times when it detects periods of great danger for the school . And always , of course , its advice is the same : Stand together , be strong from within . ” “ Ow kunnit nofe skusin danger ifzat ? ” said Ron . His mouth was so full Harry thought it was quite an achievement for him to make any noise at all . “ I beg your pardon ? ” said Nearly Headless Nick politely , while Hermione looked revolted . Ron gave an enormous swallow and said , “ How can it know if the school 's in danger if it 's a hat ? ” “ I have no idea , ” said Nearly Headless Nick . “ Of course , it lives in Dumbledore 's office , so I daresay it picks things up there . ” “ And it wants all the Houses to be friends ? ” said Harry , looking over at the Slytherin table , where Draco Malfoy was holding court . “ Fat chance . ” “ Well , now , you should n't take that attitude , ” said Nick reprovingly . “ Peaceful cooperation , that 's the key . We ghosts , though we belong to separate Houses , maintain links of friendship . In spite of the competitiveness between Gryffindor and Slytherin , I would never dream of seeking an argument with the Bloody Baron . ” “ Only because you 're terrified of him , ” said Ron . Nearly Headless Nick looked highly affronted . “ Terrified ? I hope I , Sir Nicholas de Mimsy - Porpington , have never been guilty of cowardice in my life ! The noble blood that runs in my veins — ” “ What blood ? ” asked Ron . “ Surely you have n't still got — ? ” “ It 's a figure of speech ! ” said Nearly Headless Nick , now so annoyed his head was trembling ominously on his partially severed neck . “ I assume I am still allowed to enjoy the use of whichever words I like , even if the pleasures of eating and drinking are denied me ! But I am quite used to students poking fun at my death , I assure you ! ” “ Nick , he was n't really laughing at you ! ” said Hermione , throwing a furious look at Ron . Unfortunately , Ron 's mouth was packed to exploding point again and all he could manage was “ node iddum eentup sechew , ” which Nick did not seem to think constituted an adequate apology . Rising into the air , he straightened his feathered hat and swept away from them to the other end of the table , coming to rest between the Creevey brothers , Colin and Dennis . “ Well done , Ron , ” snapped Hermione . “ What ? ” said Ron indignantly , having managed , finally , to swallow his food . “ I 'm not allowed to ask a simple question ? ” “ Oh forget it , ” said Hermione irritably , and the pair of them spent the rest of the meal in huffy silence . Harry was too used to their bickering to bother trying to reconcile them ; he felt it was a better use of his time to eat his way steadily through his steak - and - kidney pie , then a large plateful of his favorite treacle tart . When all the students had finished eating and the noise level in the hall was starting to creep upward again , Dumbledore got to his feet once more . Talking ceased immediately as all turned to face the headmaster . Harry was feeling pleasantly drowsy now .

Dumbledore continued , “ Tryouts for the House Quidditch teams will take place on the — ” He broke off , looking inquiringly at Professor Umbridge . As she was not much taller standing than sitting , there was a moment when nobody understood why Dumbledore had stopped talking , but then Professor Umbridge said , “ Hem , hem , ” and it became clear that she had got to her feet and was intending to make a speech . Dumbledore only looked taken aback for a moment , then he sat back down smartly and looked alertly at Professor Umbridge as though he desired nothing better than to listen to her talk . Other members of staff were not as adept at hiding their surprise . Professor Sprout 's eyebrows had disappeared into her flyaway hair , and Professor McGonagall 's mouth was as thin as Harry had ever seen it . No new teacher had ever interrupted Dumbledore before . Many of the students were smirking ; this woman obviously did not know how things were done at Hogwarts . “ Thank you , Headmaster , ” Professor Umbridge simpered , “ for those kind words of welcome . ” Her voice was high - pitched , breathy , and little - girlish and again , Harry felt a powerful rush of dislike that he could not explain to himself ; all he knew was that he loathed everything about her , from her stupid voice to her fluffy pink cardigan .
